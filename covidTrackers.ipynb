    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Coronavirus trackers have been proved to be one of the best methods for early detection and contention of the spread of the virus. The job of a tracker is quite simple: to contact with those people in close interaction with a coronavirus positive-tested person. It is widely known that Spain, and in particular Madrid, has had a notable lack of trained people for carrying this activity, and, therefore, military personnel and health workers have been used for tracking, alongside some private companies. Thus, the optimal distribution of the trackers of all companies in each region of a country is an important task. The goal of this project is to obtain that optimal distribution for Spain."

    "In this section we will derive a mathematical definition of our problem as an optimization problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $x_{ij}$ be the number of employees from company $i \\in C$ working for the government of the region $j \\in R$, where $C$ and $ R $ represent the sets of companies and regions of the country, respectively. We want to find the $ x_{ij} $ such that the number of positive cases detected by all trackers is maximum. Each tracker will detect some average number of positives. We assume that this number does not depend on the company nor the region. Therefore, it is a global constant and we will not take it into account. We consider that the number of positives in a region detected by some company depend on three factors. \n",
    "- The number of detected positives will depend on the population of the region. The greater the population, the faster the virus can spread, and the greater the number of positives to be detected. \n",
    "- Also, the greater the accumulated incidence of a region, the more likely is to find infected people. As trackers are a tool for avoiding the spread in the early stages of the pandemic, we will favor those regions with a *middle* accumulated incidence. If the incidence is too large then for any reasonable amount of trackers they are simply not able to track all close contacts. \n",
    "- Finally, we will assume that each region manages its own healthcare system. That is, we suppose a not heavily centralized country in health affairs, like Spain. Therefore, for reasons of proximity, we will favor those companies who are working for the governments of their region. This allows for easier communication, for a better knowledge of local culture (crowded places, language...), avoid different timezones, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "We denote $ w_{ij} $ as the weight that a given worker of company $ i $ works for the $ j $ region. $ w_{ij} $ can be expressed as the product of the three aforementioned factors,\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    w_{ij} = \\frac{\\tilde{w}_{ij}}{\\sum_j \\tilde{w}_{ij}},\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",

    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    \\tilde{w}_{ij} = \\tilde{w}_{j}^{\\text{inc}} \\cdot \\tilde{w}_{j}^{\\text{pop}} \\cdot \\tilde{w}_{ij}^{\\text{loc}}.\n",

    "where $ \\text{inc}_j $ is the cumulative 14-days incidence of region $ j $, and $ \\text{inc}_{\\text{max}} $ is some incidence for which $ \\tilde{w}_{j}^{\\text{inc}} $ is maximum. The election of a particular shape for $ \\tilde{w}_{j}^{\\text{inc}} $ has been guided by the desire of $ \\tilde{w}_{j}^{\\text{inc}} $ to have lower values for small and large values of $ \\text{inc}_j $.\n",
    "- The second weight measures the population of the region $ j $,\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    \\tilde{w}_{j}^{\\text{pop}} = \\frac{\\text{population}_j}{\\mu_{\\text{pop}}},\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "where $ \\mu_{\\text{pop}} $ is the mean population of the regions of the country. The fact that we divided by $ \\mu_{\\text{pop}} $ guarantees that $ \\tilde{w}_{j}^{\\text{pop}} $ is of order of unity (except for very large or very small regions), therefore it works as a modulator for $ \\tilde{w}_{j}^{\\text{inc}} $. Observed that we assumed linearity on population dependence.\n",
    "- The last weight measures the proximity of the company $ i $ to the region $ j $,\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    \\tilde{w}_{ij}^{\\text{loc}} = 1 + \\delta_{ij},\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "where $ \\delta_{ij} $ is a Kronecker delta with value 1 if the location of $ i $ is the region $ j $, and 0 if not. Notice that, again, this weight is of the order of the unity, and it doubles the unweighted probability of a government choosing a company with which it shares the same region. \n",
    "\n",
    "The objective function can be formulated as\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    z = \\sum_{ij} w_{ij} x_{ij} = \\frac{ \\tilde{w}_{j}^{\\text{inc}} \\cdot \\tilde{w}_{j}^{\\text{pop}} \\cdot \\tilde{w}_{ij}^{\\text{loc}} }{\\sum_j \\tilde{w}_{ij}} x_{ij}.\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Having introduced the objective function, let us define the constraints:\n",
    "- Each region must have a minimum number of trackers. This number depends on the recommended number of trackers per people by authorities and on the population of the region. International health organizations recommend a tracker for every 5500 people (https://www.lasexta.com/noticias/nacional/madrid-y-navarra-a-la-cola-en-numero-de-rastreadores-por-cantidad-de-habitantes_202008125f34061b2676530001701eca.html),\n",

    "    \\sum_i x_{ij} \\geq x_j^{\\text{min}} = f \\frac{1}{5500} \\cdot \\text{population}_j,\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "where $ 0 \\leq f \\leq 1 $ is some constant. The constant $f$ reflects the fact that regions will probably have a lower fraction of trackers than recommended due to shortage of trackers and unwillingness to expend money, but at least they should have a significant number of trackers compared to authorities guidelines.\n",
    "- Each company has some number of employees, and the sum of employees in each region must not exceed it,\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    \\sum_j x_{ij} \\leq \\text{trackers}_i.\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "- Each region devotes some funds to pay the trackers. The amount of expenses for each region cannot be higher than its budget. Every company must pay a salary to each tracker --- though cases has been observed where it has been expected for trackers to work for free. We assume that the salary is a constant for each tracker in a given company. The amount of money spent must satisfy\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    \\sum_{i} \\text{salary}_i x_{ij} \\leq \\text{budget}_j.\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "All the ingredients for the minimization problem are introduced. We can summarize them as follows:\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    \\begin{split}\n",
    "        \\max_{x} &\\sum_{ij} w_{ij} x_{ij} \\\\\n",
    "        s.t. \\quad & \\sum_i x_{ij} \\geq x_j^{\\text{min}} = f \\frac{1}{5500} \\cdot \\text{population}_j \\\\\n",
    "        & \\sum_j x_{ij} \\leq \\text{trackers}_i \\\\\n",
    "        & \\sum_{i} \\text{salary}_i x_{ij} \\leq \\text{budget}_j\n",
    "    \\end{split}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that $ x_{ij} $ has not been assumed to be an integer number of workers. This might be understood by the fact that trackers can be hired for some number of hours per day, or that they can work for several regions in the same company some amount of time of their total workday resulting in $ x_{ij} $ being non-integer. Nevertheless, the continuum assumption for $ x_{ij} $ has its limitations because in practice it is not posible for workers to follow schedules with, say, 8 decimal precision. The main point is that non-integrity for $ x_{ij} $ can be readily interpreted and applied within some precision."

    "- For the number of trackers on each company, it can seen that for all companies the sensitivities are positive and of the order of $10^{-1}$ or $10^{-2}$. This sensitivities are comparable to non-zero variations of the budget constraint.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the previous analysis it can be concluded that training more trackers and increasing the budget to hire them affects positively to the effective detection of positives. Nevertheless, as sensitivities are of several orders of magnitude lower than the value of the objective function, this task should be performed on a great scale to produce noticeable improvements on the objective function."

    "For a company it might not be efficient to split their trackers into small groups. To work for the government of a certain region, the company needs access to the health system databases of that region, setting up their network of computers and phones, and having meetings for the coordination of the tracking with authorities. Creating a group in a company that works for a region requires devoting time and money that is not directly used to track people. This initial time and money expenses cause that for a small group these *wasted* resources per unit tracker are high. Furthermore, as incidence suffers from great variability, it is possible to find that in order to achieve optimality it is required to eliminate some small groups (because of improvement of incidence, or worsening in other regions) and transfer the workers into other groups where their work is required. This probability of discarding small groups from time to time means that initial *wasted* resources constitute a large part of the total expenses of that group. Therefore it is not worth to have very small groups. Similarly, it is not worth to have very large groups of trackers in a company working for a single region. If there are large groups, then, if exists, the rest of the groups must be small, thus suffering from the problems exposed before; if they do not exist, then it might be the case that in a given time, due to variations in incidence, a new small group must be created. All in all, it is desirable to divide the workers of a given company in groups of medium size to save time and money.\n",

    "To study the execution time as a function of the size of the problem 18 values for the dimension of the the $x_{ij}$ matrix has been used. For each value, appropriate values for parameters has been chosen, so that a solution is likely to exist and have a realistic meaning. Next, random values and corresponding files have been created. Lastly, the model is created and solved. The execution time is the time processing the function `solve_model`. This process has been repeated for 10 different seed values, ranging from 0 to 8. The reason to repeat this process is that, for some values of $n$ and for some seeds, the execution time is quite large, far more than its predecessor and successor. Therefore, for 9 values these large execution times appear as outliers. Clearly, considering more seeds would produce more accurate trend results and statistical inference, but the total execution time increase faster than linearly ---because of outliers--- and with these 9 points significant information can be extracted."

    "Coefficients can be obtained from linear regression, but they are not meaningful because time measurements depend heavily on open and background processes of the computer and vary notably between computers. Furthermore, nor heteroskedasticity (variation of data depends on $n$) nor normality (slightly skewed distribution towards higher times) are satisfied, thus statistical inference becomes non-trivial. The main insight is the empirical observation of exponential time dependence on the size of the problem. "

    "An interesting parameter to analyze is the dependence on the available number of trackers. It is expected that the number of detected cases increases as the number of trackers increases, but the exact dependence can be nonlinear.\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of trackers depends on the constant $f$, the fraction of recommended trackers by health authorities, which is $1/5500$. An increase of this constant produces an increase of the total number of trackers. Therefore, analyze the dependence of the objective function on the constant $f$ it is equivalent to analyze the detected cases as a function on the number of trackers.\n",
    "\n",
    "A set of values for $f$ has been generated, ranging from $0.1 \\cdot \\frac{1}{5500}$ to $1.35 \\cdot \\frac{1}{5500}$ in steps of $0.5$ units. Some values that had a considerable execution time has not been considered. The same seed has been used for all values of $f$, which was the same as in b), thus the same data has been used except for the number of trackers."

    "From this Figure it can be observed that the objective function initially follows a linear trend, but then starts to saturate. The starting linear increase is intuitive: the more trackers, the higher the detection rate. For the saturation of the objective functions, there are at least two possible explanations:\n",
    "- There are enough workers to track all positives. Thus the average number of positives detected per tracker, which we assumed constant, decreases. In economic terms, this is a case of high offer of trackers. Of course, if there were more than enough trackers salaries might decrease, but those considerations are out of the scope of the analysis.\n",
    "- The total budget imposes a restriction on the number of trackers to be hired. Thus, very few of these new trackers actually work. In economic terms, this is a case of low demand of trackers, because regions are not willing to increase their expending."
